# BR-PlayZone
BR PlayZone also known as “The Circle” is the area where players must remain during the game. If outside of the playzone, players take damage every second.
This forces players closer to each other as the game progresses in order to speed up the game.

  ## How It Works:
  Set cords for final playzone which will then create a radius around that specific position.
  
  Each playzone can consist of several tiers as defined above. 
  
  As the playzone begins to close, it will gradually continue until it reaches the next tier.

  This will repeat until it reaches the final playzone. 
  
  Server owners can adjust closing_speed, tier_zone damage and more using the provided json.

  ## THIS IS A WIP
